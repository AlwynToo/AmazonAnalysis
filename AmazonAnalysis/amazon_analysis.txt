1. Product Performance Metrics which included sales velocity, revenue per sku, top selling ASINs and SKU concentration in the product_analyzer.py is not overlapping pricing_analyzer.py, margin_analyzer.py, geo_analyzer.py, inventory_analyzer.py and order_analyzer.py. Please confirm this

+++++++++++++++++
Module Responsibilities
Module	Key Metrics	Scope	Data Used
product_analyzer.py	Sales velocity, Revenue/SKU, Top ASINs, SKU concentration	Product-level performance	SKU, ASIN, Quantity, Item Price
pricing_analyzer.py	Price elasticity, Competitor price gaps, Optimal price points	Price optimization	Item Price, Promotion Discounts, Marketplace
margin_analyzer.py	Profit margin, COGS, FBA fees, Returns cost	Profitability	COGS, Fees, Returns Data (not in order report)
geo_analyzer.py	Regional hotspots, State-level sales, Postal code density	Geographic trends	Ship State, Ship Postal Code
inventory_analyzer.py	Stock turnover, Days of supply, Stockout rate	Inventory health	Inventory Snapshots (not in order report)
order_analyzer.py	Order processing time, Fulfillment channel efficiency	Order operations	Order Status, Fulfillment Channel
+++++++++++++++++++

Currently I only have order report data, what metric can be analyzed for time being? Other metrics will be explored in the future. 

can you explain product_analyzer.py # SKU/ASIN metrics, how it could help to optimizing Amazon Sales for profit growth?

1. Key Metrics Analyzed
Metric	Formula/Description	Profit Impact
Sales Velocity	Units Sold / Time Period	Prioritize fast-moving SKUs for inventory/staffing focus
Profit Margin	(Revenue - COGS - Fees) / Revenue	Flag low-margin SKUs for price adjustments/discontinuation
Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)	Revenue from Ads / Ad Spend	Optimize PPC campaigns for high-ROAS ASINs
Inventory Turnover	Units Sold / Average Inventory	Reduce storage costs for slow-moving SKUs
Conversion Rate	Orders / Product Page Views	Improve listings for low-converting ASINs

please stick to below structure folders of mine and give me a compilation/summary of this chat so that it can be used to another new chat. 

I think I like below structure better to separate them

Result as shown below
2025-05-16 19:38:58 - AmazonAnalysis - SUCCESS - Report saved to RegionalHotspots_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31.xlsx
PS C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AmazonAnalysis> 

But I want the report saved in Outputs folder and it should display same regional grouping and display its quantity in dashboard.html, so that I could know in a snapshoot which regions has the highest sales and lowest sales, not in excel file. Now I know why big companies request dashboard.html report. sorry to trouble you 




cd "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AmazonAnalysis"
python -m Analysis.main `
  --start_date "2024-05-01" `
  --end_date "2024-05-31" `
  --report_type regional


python -m AmazonAnalysis.Analysis.main \
  --start_date 2024-01-01 \
  --end_date 2024-01-31 \
  --report_type regional

Let me update about "In-transit shipments"
For US marketplace, it could be either FBA_FULFILLMENT_INBOUND_SHIPMENT_DATA or AWD (Amazon Warehousing and Distribution) inbound shipments while CA marketplace it only FBA_FULFILLMENT_INBOUND_SHIPMENT_DATA.




Use the Inbound Shipments Report
# Add to your script
SHIPMENT_REPORT_TYPE = ReportType.GET_FBA_FULFILLMENT_INBOUND_SHIPMENT_DATA

should be this
https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/amazon-warehousing-and-distribution-api-use-case-guide#awd-inbound-shipment-workflow

It should be this
# After (historical ledger):
report_type = ReportType.GET_LEDGER_SUMMARY_VIEW_DATA  # Inventory Ledger - Summary
NOT below
# After (historical ledger):
report_type = ReportType.GET_FBA_INVENTORY_PLANNING_DATA  # Inventory Ledger - Summary

One more thing I worried is how about those products are on the way in the shipment e.g. Ocean. to Amazon warehouse. How to obtain this shipment data


I am searching at https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/report-type-values-fba#inventory-ledger-report---summary-view
to check stock unit data and found this. I think this is what we are looking for. Can you check the website?


Since there is no weekly and monthly inventory stock units information, I am thinking starting from now on, I create a new script from 01 FBAManageInventoryReportR02.py and automate it to download weekly inventory stock and monthly inventory stock by using my hp notebook. What do you think about this idea? Here is the 01 FBAManageInventoryReportR02.py file.


You must take note that manage_inventory_report.xlsx and manage_inventory_report_CA.xlsx data show current stock unit while the order_report.xlsx provide accumulated order report from 1 January 2024 until 11 May 2025


before running analysis scripts, I need to download Amazon Order Report via API by manually input the start date and end date in 02 OrderReportR06.py and also I need to download existing inventory stock units by running 01 FBAManageInventoryReportR02.py

Structured Folder look like, what do you think? For the time being, I would like to get the Regional hotspots report first, because it is only required Order Report data directly, this should be easy. Let start easy task first.

which file is main script? where logging and error handling across all modules saved?

besides running 02 OrderReportR06.py for order report, I need to get current inventory stock units at Amazon warehouse so I run 01 FBAManageInventoryReportR02.py which located at C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AutomateSupplierOrders\01 FBAManageInventoryReportR02.py and its data save at C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AutomateSupplierOrders\FBA Manage Inventory\manage_inventory_report.xlsx for US marketplace while C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AutomateSupplierOrders\FBA Manage Inventory\manage_inventory_report_CA.xlsx for CA marketplace

I worried about the report_generator.py file might over 1000 lines because it need to accommodate 
 # Analyze SKU/ASIN metrics
 # Price optimization
 # Margin analysis
 # Regional sales hotspots
 # SEO/conversion analysis
 # B2B vs. retail trends
 # Time-based patterns
 # ASIN-level comparison

I wonder to run this analysis, do I need to manually input in many py files and execute one by one?

1. Final Folder Structure look good to me, but I have a question, are you sure each python file's line can be below 1000 lines limit?
2. Key Implementation Files
c. AmazonAnalysis/Analysis/report_generator.py
# Implement your business logic here, what is this?
3. Execution Workflow
Step 2: Run Analysis
# Date parameters (customizable)
I will give weekly start date and end date same goes to monthly start date and end date.

7. output requirement: Excel and PDF will be fine
9. **Customization**: to understand what 02 OrderReportR06.py is doing, I attached the file here.

for the time being, I do not want automation run weekly report because the Amazon Order Report is requested manually and need to specific the start date and end date, which is located and run by at C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AutomateSupplierOrders\02 OrderReportR06.py and the data are saved at C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Automation - Local\AutomateSupplierOrders\Order Report\order_report.xlsx. So I need to run 02 OrderReportR06.py before I could run a script/function to get the weekly report. Right now, I need to confirm a structured folders and understand how everything are done before generate any scripts. Ask me anything before moving to the script generation.

I prefer to run a python script on the Amazon Order Report to get to know more about 

1. Analyze Product Performance
2. Optimize Pricing Strategy
3. Improve Profit Margins
4. Geographic Targeting
5. Enhance Listings for Conversion
7. Customer Insights
8. Seasonal Trends
9. Competitor Benchmarking

what/why/how is the best ways to do it

I want a structured python scripts approach where every ipynb file within 1000 lines. Normally big company how they break down these structured approach? How their weekly report will look like?
